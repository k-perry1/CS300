Data Structures and Algorithms 22EW4

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
  In this course, we had to analyize different data structures and determine which structure to use. The project we were told to work on was a program that would parse course information from a given file, organize the courses, print a sorted list of all courses, and have the ability to search up a courses information.
  
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
  I approached this problem by focusing on the work on project one where we analyzed three different data structures. Data structures all have advantages and disadvantages depending on their application. It is important to select the right data structure for the situation. I chose to use a binary search tree as my structure after looking at the overall runtime of all the data structures and what my program would need to do.
  
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
  My biggest roadblock is that I cannot build my code. I was unable to build my code on the prior Binary Search Tree assignment, but received no feedback on how to get the code to run. Due to this, I had very little to work off of. I used the pseudocode created in Project One, the chapters in our Zybooks textbook, and past assignments to peice together how to parse the file and use the binary search tree.
  
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
  Prior to this I had no knowledge on algorithms and sorting data. This course has opened the door for learning more about algorithms to make more efficent software. Learning about this is not as intimidating as it was beforehand, and I now feel capable to further my knowledge independently.
  
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  The biggest evolution in writing my program is that I have started commenting my code in small blocks rather than line by line. Commenting line by line makes itharder for me to read and grasp what is happening. I found that commenting this way I would often just state what a line does, rather than why. In this project I started using multi-line comments before a section of code, and then in-line comments under that section if I feel more clarification is needed. In my opinion this makes the code easier to quickly go over and comprehend.
